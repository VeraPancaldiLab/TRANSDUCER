2 sets of data here

PJ2003085 wich is the data from the 4 CAFs with TRanslatome under the same name
CAF wich is the CAF primary culture rnasequencing data

For both there's metadata and rawcounts.

For CAFs, I filter out the ones from Paris and just work in the Toulouse ones.

There's different problems with the IDs and in the CAFs case i take metadata from CAF_annot
and Manip.xlsx and create CAFs metadata.
