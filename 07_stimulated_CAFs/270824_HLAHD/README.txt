This analysis was performed in the Genelogin cluster due to dificulties on its addaptation.
Thus the structure of this folder resembles that of the server with /work/ and /save/ directories.

Inside /safe/ the software configuration and data is stored


In /work/ the scripts, results and output is kept.


For the sake of memory, input fastqs are not in this folder and rather in the CRCT06/ server
A file ending in  .structure is also given to replicate that original of the server at the moment this code was run


to run the script in the server a code as such was utilised: 

*sbatch hlahd1.3_cafstimul_full.sh hPSC975_IFNg_2_S25*
